# Ruby-Project

Ruby is most used for building web applications. 
However, it is a general-purpose language similar to Python, 
so it has many other applications like data analysis, prototyping, and proof of concepts. 

Probably the most obvious implementation of Ruby is Rails web, the development framework built with Ruby.
